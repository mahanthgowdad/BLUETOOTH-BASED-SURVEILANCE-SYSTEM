# BLUETOOTH-BASED-SURVEILANCE-SYSTEM
This project implements a surveillance system using an Arduino microcontroller, the HC-05 Bluetooth module, an IR sensor, and a buzzer. The system monitors for unauthorized access and sends alerts via Bluetooth while triggering an audible alarm.

## Features
- *Motion Detection*: Utilizes an IR sensor to detect movement or unauthorized access.
- *Bluetooth Communication*: Uses the HC-05 module to notify the user via a paired Bluetooth device.
- *Audible Alert*: Activates a buzzer upon motion detection.
- *Remote Control*: Enables or disables monitoring remotely via Bluetooth commands (E to enable, D to disable).

## Components Used
1. *Arduino Board*: Microcontroller to process signals and control components.
2. *HC-05 Bluetooth Module*: Wireless communication with a paired device.
3. *IR Sensor*: Detects motion or intrusion.
4. *Buzzer*: Sounds an alarm upon detection.
5. *Power Supply*: Provides power to the system.

## How It Works
1. The IR sensor detects motion by monitoring infrared signals.
2. When motion is detected, the system:
   - Activates the buzzer to alert nearby users.
   - Sends a notification via Bluetooth to the paired device.
3. Bluetooth commands (E or D) allow the user to enable or disable monitoring remotely.

## Code Overview
### Main Application
- *Monitoring Logic*: Continuously monitors the IR sensor and activates/deactivates the buzzer based on the detection status.
- *Bluetooth Commands*:
  - E: Enables monitoring.
  - D: Disables monitoring.

### UART Communication
- Handles serial communication with the Bluetooth module.
- Supports data transmission for single characters and strings.

### Bluetooth Configuration
- Configures the HC-05 module's name using the set_bluetooth_name function.

### Interrupt Handling
- Utilizes the USART RX Complete Interrupt to process incoming Bluetooth commands in real time.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- *Software*: Arduino IDE for uploading the code.
- *Hardware*: The components listed above.

### Steps
1. Assemble the circuit as per the schematic.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Pair the HC-05 module with your Bluetooth device.
4. Send commands (E or D) via a Bluetooth terminal app to control the system.
